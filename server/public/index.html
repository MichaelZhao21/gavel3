        <h1>This is not the frontend you are looking for</h1>
        <p>
            The dev server should be run with Docker. If you are running manually, run the frontend
            node app and backend rust app separately. Note that on the development instance, this
            will be the page that the button takes you to due to the nature of the app. Simply go to
            the judge login page and enter the code.
